   We were on the 6th week of the UX/UI Design Bootcamp at Ironhack Berlin, and for this week’s project we had to create a microsite for any event that we choose.
A microsite differs from a site as it is mainly focused for a key campaign or event. It is usually a single page and don’t have a menu, it is normally quite different from the main website and don’t need follow the brand style.
1st: choose the event
As a solo project, I was looking for something that inspired me, as for that I started looking for events that I had visited in the past.
Some of those had already a very beautiful website, like Barcelona Knits, and some others just don’t had enough information to construct the microsite with.
After some thought I ended up visiting the BurgerDeveloper blog. They started some years ago as a group of friends gathering together to eat burgers and talk about the games that they were developing at the moment. By now they celebrate the IDBA (Indie Developer Burger Awards) in Barcelona every year.
Last year, I had the opportunity to attend to the IDBA as a representative of the indie studio Kraftum Games, and I loved it. People of this industry are friendly and funny, the awards are very entertaining and is a great opportunity to meet new people.
2nd: The insights
This project was much more about UI than UX, so just one day of five to invest.
First of all I collected all information that I was going to use for the microsite and made and overall idea of how it would appear depending on the moment: before, during or after the event.
Then I looked for some microsites inspiration, I found the Lucidworks beautiful and very clear, and the burgerbff as a fun and fresh site. And some competitive analysis like The Game Awards.
During my research I came up with this poll from Hashnode were 92% of participants voted that they prefer the dark mode on their code editor. And that stood with me during all the process.
3th: The mood
As said black was the main background colour, with white on it. The mood board was based with two really famous indie games, Limbo and Hollow Knight, both of them use the illumination over black.
As the principal target are people that love games I added some mythic games as Pac-Man and Space Inviders.
As last I based the typography on the Monkey Island, another iconic game where most of the time was spent reading what the characters were saying.
